summary for today's lecture:

today's lecture was an introduction to the HTML and markdown app. HTML stands for hypertext markup language which is used to design beautiful and creative webpages and websites. In order to create a webpage we first write plain text and then execute it through a markdown app and it provides the client with a formatted HTML document. In case of Github this markdown app is replaced by an inbuilt server that converts our plain text into an HTML document. We were also taught how to create a readme file and create our personal profile in a seperate repositiory in our github account by the name of username.github.io. Sir also gave an insight into XML another markup language that is majorly used to store data and content.
